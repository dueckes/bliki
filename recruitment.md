# On Recruitment

## Assessing Code Skills
You wouldn't let a builder construct your home without clear evidence they are competent in construction.  They provide clear evidence of their competence through certifications, materials demonstrating their previous works and customer testimonials. 
Whilst proof of skill is different for developers, the same principle applies.

Software organisations that recognise great software is key to enabling sustainable delivery pace and commercial success will invest heavily in assuring their new hires are skilled developers.
They won't risk developers tainting their most important asset.  They won't assess solely against what has been discussed and drawn on whiteboards - they'll want to see real working code.  They'll want total assurance the candidate can put that into practice.

There are a variety of ways organisations assess for assurance of coding skill.  Each organisation takes there own approach underpinned by the importance they place on the skill of crafting great software.
The industry has infamously failed at certification programs, with no widely recognised and respected body assessing skill and deciding seniority.

The approaches I've seen practiced that are able to assess skill effectively are:
- Give the candidate a coding test as homework
- Assess a portfolio of work put forward by the candidate, such as open source contributions
- Pair with the candidate on a problem that's artificial or real
- Employ another specialist recruitment organisation that understands your software quality bar and does one of the above for you(!)

In each case, an organisation serious about code would:
- Assess code solving problems of similar complexity to what the job demands
- Give the candidate every opportunity to demonstrate design skill, an ability to coherently organise the software for understandability and testability
- Never automate the entire assessment, recognising that assessing code is akin to assessing a novel, and that code is intended for humans first and foremost and not the machine

## Demonstrating Organisation Skill & Values
Recruitment offers an opportunity to build your organisation's reputation in the industry.
The experience, process and feedback given to candidates reflects the organisations competence and how much it values software.

Recruitment presents _the gateway to the soul_ of the organisation for candidates.  It's a representation of what the organisation truly values.
An organisation recruiting in haste and sacrificing elements of assessment clearly does not hold those elements dear.
An organisation that does not code collaboratively with the candidate at some stage similarly does not value collaborative development.
An organisation that chooses to assess basic problems clearly does not understand software at all as design skill is necessary, crucial and complex - basically design is at the essence of what's being assessed.
