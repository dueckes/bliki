# On TDD
I started in the [Detroit School of TDD](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Detroit-school-TDD), have been to [London School](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/London-school-TDD), but have found my way back to the Detroit School.
I apply an Outside-In variant where the focus is on working to clarify the outermost behaviours required first.
