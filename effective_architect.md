## The Modern Architect: The 'Software Development Coach'

The modern architect works with autonomous, cross-functional teams and apply their role in servant leadership style.
They often have a wealth of experience working with agile practices that span all parts of the organisation, and so are capable coaches on both agile and technical practices.
