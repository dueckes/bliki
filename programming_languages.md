# Programming Languages

## Guidance On Choosing A Programming Language
The following is relevant for any organisation medium size upwards that pursues excellence in engineering.  The thinking around long-lived systems is amplified for long-lived and business critical systems.

### General Guidelines
<ins>Longevity of system effects choice</ins>
- A language used in long-lived systems is a long term commitment to the language by the organisation.
- The choice of language for short-lived systems is less of an issue because the team and people writing it will likely own it for it’s entire lifetime.

<ins>Using what you know poses less risk and assures sustainable pace</ins>
- For common programming problems, using a common language best known by the organisation and team poses low risk and assures sustainable pace.  Using uncommon languages on problems easily solved in common languages is counter-intuitive because of the risks involved.
- Using a language well known by the organisation poses less risk to sustainable pace as you can leverage knowledge and capability across the organisation.
- Teams foster contribution from outside their team by using languages widely used within their organisation.
- It is more challenging for organisations to retain skills in uncommon languages.

<ins>Think about what’s best for the problem domain</ins>
- Teams working in a domain are best served using a common language to allow the architecture of the domain to evolve with greatest flexibility.
- Strongly consider using languages best suited to solving the problem at hand if a language has features or libraries that are compelling.

<ins>Learning a language is a significant investment for the organisation and it’s people</ins>
- It’s in an organisations interest to build a reputation as a destination employer for those wanting to master languages used its long-lived systems.  This means a commitment to teaching and mastery of the language and promotion of the organisations interest and skill in the language to the developer community.
- Mastery of a language takes years of effort, the learning effort involved is significant.
- A team investing in learning a language means time not spent on other activities which can provide more significant benefit to the team capability and customer outcomes.
- The maintenance costs of a language are significant, including patches and upgrades.
- Developers should be encouraged to learn the enduring principles underpinning good software first and foremost.  Learning a variety of programming languages to improve their general development skill is important, but secondary.

<ins>Writing code faster is not the problem</ins>
- Language choices focused on writing code faster are often poor, underestimating total ownership costs, which by far exceed writing costs.
- No language has been proven to increase programming productivity or produce cleaner code.  These things are most influenced by the principles of good software and practices that aid its creation.

<ins>Know the risks in the choice</ins>
- There should be benefits to choosing a language that by far exceeds any organisational risk.
- A team learning to use a language on long-lived and business critical systems is counter-intuitive because the risk of error is more significant.  You wouldn’t trust your car to a mechanic who is still learning from a handbook.
- Immature languages pose higher risk of both language and knowledge continuity.

### Factors Influencing A Choice To Consolidate Or Diversify

#### Consolidate?
- Leads to deep knowledge and efficiency in development, language mastery is more likely.
- Leads to deeper collaboration between engineers, sharing of knowledge and advice is more likely.
- When within a domain, supports the architectural evolution of that domain, such as correcting boundaries of systems, merging and splitting systems to address cross-functional requirements.
- Brings focus to other learning opportunities that can be more impactful, such as development practices and methods, architecture and design.
- Assists with business continuity, less skill is required in replacement staff, less new starter learning effort is required.
- Leads to a more portable workforce, where engineers can shift problem spaces and be more productive sooner.
- The vast majority of problems are suited to any modern programming languages and efficiencies working in particular languages are minimal.
- It’s more likely that the organisation can build a reputation for language mastery.

#### Diversify?
- Allows problems to be solved by the best suited languages, when applicable.
- Can lift productivity in the short-term, teams can choose a language they are most familiar with.
- Can lift morale, teams can choose the tools they are happiest to work with.
- Serves to improve the general programming skills of developers.
- Broadens the pool of developers in the market that are employable.
- Broadens career opportunities for developers.
- Risks resume driven development, learning for the sake of furthering ones career at the risk of good and sustainable pace of software development.
