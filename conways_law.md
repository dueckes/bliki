## On Inverting The Law

This is best done by thinking of problems independent of organisation structure, which is easier said than done.
The organisation structure should not be a constraint in the solution - it should be malleable, able to be reorganised to best realise a simple solution.
Solutions should be proposing the simplest architecture (following the simplest possible thing programming principle) and recommending an organisation structure that best meets that. 

Critical here is recognising that the architecture/design is more crucial to the long term success of the organisation than the organisations structure.
Tribalism and insular thinking puts the architecture at risk.
