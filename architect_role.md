## Basic Summary

### Clarity Of Vision
- Map and understand current state of systems
- Express the desired state
- Spread and refine vision
- Display current state and vision in physical space
- Highlight areas of focus
- Update when state changes

### Build Bridges Across The Organisation
- Build relationships with teams and business
- Partner and consult with teams (on projects)
- Connect work to the vision, especially during inceptions
- Within reason, permit team experimentation outside the common tools and vision and feedback to the organisation

### Find Opportunities for Change
- When possible, connect visionary moves with business lead initiatives
- Sell technical initiatives with a focus on business values and risk reduction

### Build a Community of Learning
- Have senior technologists meet regularly and share learnings and progress
- Communities of Practice (CoPs) are a great vehicle for this
